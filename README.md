# rentorbuy

## Highlights
* Calculate total cost of owning a home using 14 applicable variables
* Calculate total cost of renting a home using 10 applicable variables
* Visualize break-even points and opportunity cost 

## Overview
Determine whether market conditions warrant buying a property, 
or if one should rent in the meantime. Decision is made upon the following variables:
As market conditions change, buying or renting may be more favourable. 
The decision to buy or rent a home is different from person-to-person and related 
to an individual's income, location, age, marriage status. 

Rent or buy is a visualizer to help determine whether it is more
beneificial to rent a house or buy a house given the current market variables
and buyer preferences. The app is built using Vite frontend tooling as well as 
React.js and Chart.js libraries. 

Other tools I saw available either did not account for certain important
variables, or did not separate out certain variables from one another which
made interpretation difficult. With this tool, one can clearly see what a change
in one variable would explicitly change with the total cost and break-even points.

## Usage
