# rentorbuy

Determine whether market conditions warrant buying a property, or if one should rent in the meantime. Decision is made upon the following variables:
    - home price
    - property taxes
    - mortgage rates
    - property maintenance costs
    - opportunity cost of the downpayment
    - homeowner incentives
        - Government-backed home loans and mortgage assistance (U.S.)
        - Homeownership vouchers for first-time home buyers (U.S.)
        - Real estate and federal lands for sale by the government (U.S.)
As market conditions change, buying or renting may be more favourable. The decision to buy or rent a home is different from person-to-person and related to an individual's income, location, age, marriage status. 

Visualization:
    - compare buying decisions among different states and countries
    - see how the cost of owning a home changes over the lifecycle of a thirty year mortgage
